Folders:

"training-originals": 
The training images of the 10 subjects.
The subdirectory "training_used_in_fpiv04_paper" includes the subset of the training images which 
was used in our FPIV'04 paper to compute the 3D head models of the subjects. 
For a direct comparison to our results we suggest to use the same subset.


"training-synthetic":
Synthetic face images generated from the 3D head models.
These images were used in our FPIV'04 paper for training the component-based face recognition system.

"test":
The 200 test images per subject.
These images were used in our FPIV'04 paper for testing the recognition system.

"paper":
FPIV'04 paper.

"license"
License agreement, terms of use.
